Velociraptor

TODO
Implement the "catchPrey" method in Velociraptor

ASSUMPTIONS
Lead values are double-precision. Speed values are integer.
The Velociraptor has a top speed of 40 MPH
The Velociraptor gains 1 MPH per second while chasing the Prey up to its top speed, then loses 1 MPH per second until its speed is 0 MPH.
The Prey starts at and maintains its top speed during the entire chase.
If the Velociraptor's speed reaches 0 MPH before catching the Prey, the Prey escapes
If the Prey has a top speed faster than the Velociraptor, the Prey escapes.
"catchPrey" should return the number of seconds it takes the Velociraptor to catch the Prey as a whole number, or -1 if the Prey escapes
