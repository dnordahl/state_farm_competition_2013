Security Matrix

TODO
Implement all methods in SecurityMatrix
Update the Role class as needed.
Update the Action and Day enums as needed, but do not add any new values to either.

ASSUMPTIONS
The default roles are ADMIN, DEV, TEST, and READONLY.
ADMIN role can do every action every day of the week.
DEV role can do every action during the work week (Monday thru Friday), but can only READ on the weekend(Saturday and Sunday) because of a maintenance window.
TEST role can READ, WRITE, and UPDATE during the work week (Monday thru Friday), but can only READ on the weekend(Saturday and Sunday) because of a maintenance window.
READONLY role can READ ever day of the week.
When a role is added, it is assumed to have no access by default.
Role name is used to determine if the role already exists.
When granting or revoking access, if no days are passed, grant or revoke access for all days.
When finding roles, days, or actions, the resulting list should be sorted as follows:
	roles - alphabetically by the name of the role, case-insensitive
	days - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
	actions - Create, Read, Update, Delete
	
THE SECURITY MATRIX MUST MAINTAIN ITS STATE FOR THE ENTIRE TEST CASE.  THE TEST CASES BUILD UPON ONE ANOTHER.
