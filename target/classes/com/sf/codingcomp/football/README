TODO
Implement "addPlayer", "wins", and "total" methods in Team.
Implement "calculateTotalScore" in Quarterback, RunningBack, and WideReceiver

ASSUMPTIONS
Quarterback touchdowns are worth 5 points and yards are 1 point per 25.
RunningBack touchdowns are worth 6 points and yards are 1 point per 10.
WideReceiver touchdowns are worth 6 points and yards are 1 point per 10.
LeagueOptions contain configurable options for maximum players at each position and whether or not to allow partial points.
The team that scores the most points always wins.  There will be no ties.


PARTIAL POINTS
When using partial points, the total needs to be rounded to 2 decimal places
partialPointsAllowed = true means 67 yards for a RunningBack = 6.7 points
partialPointsAllowed = false means 67 yards for a RunningBack = 6 points
