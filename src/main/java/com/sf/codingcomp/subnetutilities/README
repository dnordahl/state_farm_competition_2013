The SubnetImpl class needs to be implemented. An IP address and a subnet mask are all that you need
in order to calculate what IPs are in that subnet and what the special addresses are.

Hint: Try to pass all "simple" tests first and then move to the advanced ones.
The "simple" tests will assume that the IP address passed into your constructor is the broadcast (last)
address of the subnet. The "advanced" tests may pass in any address in that subnet and still expect
you to calculate the broadcast address.

e.g.
Simple test:
.getBroadcastAddress(): IP 192.168.1.0 and mask int 24 are passed into your constructor. Broadcast address is 192.168.1.255.
Advanced test:
.getBroadcastAddress(): IP 192.168.1.1 and mask int 24 are passed into your constructor. Broadcast address is still 192.168.1.255.

Assumptions:
IPv4 only.
